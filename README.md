It's web page with a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. Was created with HTML, CSS & Vanilla JS. It allows you to play rock paper scissors against ~~incredibly smart~~ randomly choosing computer. The idea for project was taken from The Odin Project. More informations about project idea you can find [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).
